    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        For all the meat lovers. Barbecued meat in its best form! :D
    </p>
    <p>Different meat specialties can be done. We prefer burger patties ("pljeskavica"),
        cevapcici, stuffed chicken thighs and sausages! Also, you can bbq different veggies.
        Personally, I prefer pure ground beef for meat specialties.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef, according to how many people will eat (half a kilo per a big guy,
            300 grams per lady)</li>
        <li>At least 1 chicken thigh per person</li>
        <li>sausages</li>
        <li>Cheese (gouda is fine) to fill, cca 200 grams per 1 kilo of meat</li>
        <li>different veggies to taste (bell peppers, zucchini, eggplants)</li>
        <li>different spices to taste (sweet paprika, black pepper, salt)</li>
        <li>"Lepinjas", 2 per person (traditional bread similar to buns)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the ground beef with spices and form the patties and/or cevapcici. You can
            put in the finely chopped cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Open the chicken thighs and fill them up.</li>
        <li>You can also finely chop few slices of smoked bacon for extra taste.</li>
        <li>Slice the veggies if you want to barbecue them too.</li>
        <li>   Set the fire up and wait until you have plenty of embers.</li>
        <li>BBQ the chicken first, then sausages and finally the burger patties. 
            That way you'll avoid burning the patties and cevapcici.</li>
        <li>Fry according to your taste of redness.</li>
        <li>In the end, bake the veggies too.</li>
        <li>In the end, quickly bbq lepinjas soaked in meat juice and fat.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
