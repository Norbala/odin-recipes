# odin-recipes
The first project in HTML, laying out main site with links to different recipes; I'm a cook myself! ;)

Knowledge to be shown:
-creating the basic html sites
-creating the links between the sites
-showing  the knowledge of basic HTML functionalities
-finally, wrapping everything up and uploading it online via GitHub :))


Self-reflection at the end of the project:

At the beginning, I had to repeat the basic Git/GitHub functions to get again the feeling
how to connect the local machine with online repository. This will be quite important with all the upcoming projects, as GitHub will be the way of my communication with the world, which makes me excited! :-)
